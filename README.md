# Ultimate-typing-speed-test
In this Python project idea, we have built an exciting project through which you can check and even improve your typing speed. For a graphical user interface, we are going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics. This project can be used during job interviews to test a person's speed to see if they are eligible for the job.
